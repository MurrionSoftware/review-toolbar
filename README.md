Review Toolbar - To help clients to review development work
===========================================================

The intended use is to place the Review Toolbar related files in to a sub folder of your project, for example in http://yourdomain.com/review-toolbar/

Notes
-----
This is intended to be used on top of Codeigniter based projects. The review-toolbar folder name is recommended so hopefully it won't conflict with controller names.
The initial goal is to provide a convenient interface to allow clients to submit bugs and feedback.
The larger goal is to allow clients to submit bugs and feedback directly in to Basecamp with added Debug information.
